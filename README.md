# assignment-5.1-coupon-analysis
Data analysis to determine factors that influence whether customers will accept coupons.

## High-Level Results
At a high level, customers were more likely to accept coupons for activities that they did frequently on their own. For example, customers were more likely to accept a coupon for a bar if they had frequented a bar recently. Similarly, customers were more likely to accept a coupon for an expensive restaurant if they had been to one recently. This effect was stronger for customers that had repeatedly been to expensive restaurants. Age and income were not driving factors in whether customers accepted these coupons.
